# PlunderBugPassThrough
I needed a script that i could enable and disable the ability to share my internet to the adapter that was showing up as the PlunderBug, so that my target machine could still show it was getting online. This will create a bridge if it does not exist and use br0 to share the internet from your main interface to the plunderbug.
